**Important Notice:**  
This open-source version of the plugin is no longer maintained. It may contain bugs and lack some features. I recommend using the **Fab version** for the most up-to-date features, bug fixes, and ongoing support. The Fab version is available [here](https://www.fab.com/listings/66e0d72e-982f-4d9e-aaaf-13a1d22efad1).
